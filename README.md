# Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

<h1> Step 1: Initialize the scripts, configs and dependendencies </h1>

Before starting the server, initialize the project by installing dependencies. 

<code> npm run init </code>

This command will Install project dependencies.

<h1> Step 2: Start the Server </h1>

Run the server to enable backend functionality:

<code> npm run start:server </code>

This command will initialize the backend, generate local url for mobile app and make the API accessible.

<h1> Step 3: Run the Flutter App </h1>

Once the server is running, start the Flutter application:

<code> flutter run </code>

This will launch the mobile app and connect it to the backend.

Notes:

Ensure you have Node.js and Flutter SDK installed.

The server must be running before launching the Flutter app.

If you encounter issues, check the logs and verify dependencies are installed correctly.
